# Technical installation
### system requirements:
- Node js v16 +
- angular cli
- nx
- python 3.8 +

Navigate into the directory containing the repository and do the following:
### For the front end:
once here run "npm install" <br/>
![carbon1](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/7424615f-2df5-416c-bc15-c4782782752e)

to start the app run "npm run start:app:dev" <br/>
![carbon2](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/5c53f47f-21ea-4869-b9cd-2751e12d5a45)

[Note] Keep in mind the app will not fully work without the backend

### For the back end:
cd into the 'api' directory <br/>
![carbon3](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/c475cee0-07a3-4563-88aa-0ba5a7a06a91)

The venv (virtual environment) is not required however, it is recommended to ensure that 
 there aren't any conflicts with existing pip (python) packages on your machine. First run 'python3 -m venv venv'. <br/>
![carbon4](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/a68ba801-17c0-4b56-b838-78c376f68d9f)


Next, run this command on Windows: <br/>
![carbon5](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/2621f422-8b6e-4541-809a-fef83c110c7c)

or

This command on Linux: <br/>

Once you have a green '(venv)' next to your cmd you have done this step correctly and continue. <br/>
![carbon7](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/e99954da-4f4f-44a6-bc8b-42271502ffde)


Now you need to install all of the packages in 'requirements.txt': <br/>
![carbon8](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/20794a9f-fb87-4ab7-bddd-30d9d74edd4a)

Navigate back to the root directory and start the API: <br/>
![carbon9](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WordWizard/assets/80365036/05ae582d-0a42-4510-8268-a9edadfe8ef1)
